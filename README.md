1. The **Simulated Dataset Generator** comprises two distinct codes, labeled "yes" and "no". As detailed in the paper, the primary distinction between these codes lies in the adjustment of the phi value within the range of [-π, π] at line 93 of the "yes" code, which is absent in the "no" code. Consequently, the performance of "no" deteriorates as the shifted energy simply dissipates, and a greater proportion of energy is displaced beyond the image boundaries as B increases.

2. The **imageplotter** section contains the code responsible for generating comparative plots and tables of various standard deviations (std).

3. The **image&forms** directory serves as the repository for all comparative images generated by the imageplotter. Readers are encouraged to explore these visualizations at their discretion.

4. The **model** section encapsulates all the models referenced in our research paper.
